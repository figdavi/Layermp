# keymapper
A simple Python script using [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/) library to create layers of key maps to keyboard with a modifier hotkey.

## Features
- **Layer-based key remapping:** Map keys dynamically to different actions using key layers.
- **Configurable modifier hotkeys:** Define modifier hotkeys to activate layers based on modes (switch and lock).
- **Customizable profiles**: Easily add, remove, edit and switch between profiles.

## Modifier Hotkey Modes:
1. **Switch**
Temporarily activate the layer by holding the modifier hotkey, similar to Shift.
2. **Lock**
- Toggle the layer on/off, similar to CapsLock.
