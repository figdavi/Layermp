# keymapper
Simple python script, using [keyboard](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard/) python library, that adds a "second" layer to keyboard using CapsLock key. 

For now, I've only mapped wasd keys to up, left, down, right, respectively, to the second layer (when CapsLock is on). This makes it easier to navigate text while staying in the home row of your keyboard.

See this [article](https://dreymar.colemak.org/layers-extend.html) for more explanation and showcase of common layer presets (Which I plan to add in the future).
